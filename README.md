Status
---
Love2dCS was designed to be as close as possible to the original LÃ–VE API, as such the documentation provided from LÃ–VE largely covers usage of Love2dCS. There is a difference between Love2dCS and LÃ–VE where is :

* The `Love.XXX.New*` in C# can access to files anywhere. In the original functin can only access the contents of the current folder.
* The `love.timer.getTime` in C# as `The time in seconds since the start of the game` beacuse of `C# double to float precision`
* The `love.math` module in LÃ–VE is named `Love.Mathf` in Love2dCS
* The `love.system` module in LÃ–VE is named `Love.Special` in Love2dCS
* The `love.thread` module in LÃ–VE is not supply, you can use [Threading.Thread](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.thread) in C# instead.
* Most index begin from 1 at LÃ–VE. However, but index will begin from 0 at Love2dCS
* Love2dCS provide more [build-in module](https://endlesstravel.github.io/#/module/build-in-module-index) to convience use.
* You can work with lua as well, but only `love.load` `love.update` and `love.draw` are native supported : [Work with lua](https://endlesstravel.github.io/#/tutorial/05.use-lua). The rest of callback function is not supported.
* Love2dCS currently based on [LÃ–VE 11.1](https://love2d.org/wiki/11.1)
